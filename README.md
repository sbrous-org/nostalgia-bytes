# Nostalgia Bytes

A collection of classic C++ games from my college days. This repository will include:

- Snake
- Car Race
- Egg Basket

## Structure

- `games/` - Contains the source code for each game in its own subfolder.
- `Makefile` - Build and run the games easily.

## How to Use

1. Add your game source code into a new subfolder under `games/` (e.g., `games/snake/`).
2. Update the `Makefile` to include your new game if needed.
3. Run `make` commands to build or play the games.

## Example

To build and run the Snake game (after adding its code):

```bash
make snake
./bin/snake
```

Feel free to add more games or improve the existing ones!
